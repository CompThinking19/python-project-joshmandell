I added the ".py" extension to your project file, so that I could get the syntax highlighting in Atom turned on; you would also need to have done this to run your code in the terminal. You seem to be off to a good start here, using the Question class in order to organize your questions. This will really help when it comes time to ask them too the user. That would seem to me to be the next step: a function that asks each question in turn. Remember that one of the major goals of this milestone was to leave meaningful comments. Your "planning" comments at the end of the file are useful, but you also need to document the code you've already written.
