Your code runs and seems to do exactly what it needs to do, which is fantastic. I'm also impressed by the way that you managed to encapsulate your code and keep it DRY: you don't ask each question individually, but instead use functions and classes in order to do the hard work for you and save some typing. One thing you're not currently doing is accounting for a user putting in garbage input. Right now, they're getting a wrong answer, but maybe you want to account for typos. My major concern at this point isn't with your code but with the ambition of the project itself: it's hard to see what issue or larger concern this is engaging with. The questions feel a little scattershot. I would encourage you to clarify a bit exactly what it is that this project is setting out to do.
